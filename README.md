# Web Scraping Tool

**Web Scraping Tool** - a tool that can scrape data from websites and save it in a structured format (e.g. CSV, TXT). This can be useful for extracting data from online sources for analysis or research purposes.

- Basically, its searching things like 'Title', 'Price', 'Description', 'Image URL' and saves them into .csv file, pretty simple.

**For this to work you should install BeautifulSoup library:**
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
> It may not be usable, only as an example of getting data from sites, so feel free to copy and edit.
