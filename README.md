# Web Scraping Tool

## About

**Web Scraping Tool** - a tool that can scrape data from websites and save it in a structured format (e.g. CSV, TXT). This can be useful for extracting data from online sources for analysis or research purposes.

- Basically, it's searching things like 'Title', 'Price', 'Description', 'Image URL' and saves them into .csv file, pretty simple. It's just an example of getting data from sites, so feel free to copy and edit.
